# Django_JedGStumpf

A Django framework website.

Intention is for this site to be a simple site about me.
Including my professional background, projects, and experiences.

TODO#

This is my first use of the Django framework so this TODO
at the time of my initial comit includes nearly everything.

I am learning this while doing::
* Using the official Django Docs
* Using a Udemy Course as a library of info
* Using YouTube for specific how-to's
* Using Google/StackOverflow/etc. for specific look ups
